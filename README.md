# Nano-Banano Payment/Swap Backend

This is a docker-compose configuration to run a payment backend to interact with Nano and Banano cryptocurrency networks. 
The Nano / Banano node each run with a corresponding pippin wallet as key manager. 

The pippin config has to be adapted accordingly. See my [pippin_nano_wallet](https://github.com/fernseher/pippin_nano_wallet) repo for the config files.
